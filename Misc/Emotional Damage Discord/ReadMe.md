You made it here? Cute.

The flag is in the server. That’s all you get. It’s not locked. It’s not protected. It’s just not for everyone.

You won’t find it by being smart. You’ll find it by not being useless.

Don’t ask for help. Don’t overthink it. If you need a hint, you’ve already failed.

This challenge wasn’t made for you. Prove me wrong.

to solve this challenge you needed to look around the server , start normal recon see welcome channel , rules etc etc , but that won't help 

The solution was hidden in plain sight within the server's emojis. Each emoji had a suspicious name—by combining the names and decoding the result with Base64, you could reveal the flag
