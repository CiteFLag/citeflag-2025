# L9owa lghachima

## Challenge Details
- **Category**: Wireless Pentesting
- **Difficulty**: Medium

## Description
The name "L9owa lghachima" translates to "brute forcing" in Arabic, providing a hint to the challenge's approach. Your mission is to hack into a specific wireless access point and discover the flag hidden within the network.

## Requirements
- Knowledge of wireless network security
- Familiarity with WPS attacks
- Experience with network traffic analysis
- Tools: Wifite, Reaver, Bully, or Aircrack-ng suite

## Solution

### Step 1: Identifying the Target
The challenge description provides the name of the target access point. This is the wireless network we need to compromise.

### Step 2: Exploiting WPS Vulnerability
Upon scanning the target network, we discover that WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) is enabled, which often presents a security vulnerability.

We can exploit this using one of several tools:
- **Wifite**: An automated wireless attack tool
- **Reaver**: Specialized for WPS brute force attacks
- **Bully**: Another effective WPS PIN brute-force tool
- **Waircut**: Windows-based alternative for WPS attacks

The attack works by brute-forcing the WPS PIN, which is typically an 8-digit number:

```bash
# Example using Reaver
reaver -i wlan0mon -b [TARGET_BSSID] -vv
```

### Step 3: Network Connection
After successfully obtaining the WPS PIN, we can connect to the wireless network using the derived credentials.

### Step 4: Finding the Flag
Many participants might instinctively:
1. Scan the subnet for other devices (which only reveals other participants' machines)
2. Try to access the router's admin dashboard (which doesn't contain the flag)

However, the flag is being broadcast in network traffic. The correct approach is to capture and analyze network packets:

#### Option 1: Using Wireshark
Open Wireshark, select the wireless interface, and apply a filter to search for "CMC" (the flag format prefix):
```
frame contains "CMC"
```

#### Option 2: Using tcpdump
For a command-line approach, use tcpdump to capture and filter packets:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -A | grep "CMC"
```

The flag appears in the broadcast traffic, requiring no interaction with specific devices on the network.

## Key Lesson
This challenge demonstrates that sometimes the goal isn't to penetrate deeper into a network, but to observe what's already visible in the network traffic. It highlights the importance of passive reconnaissance in penetration testing.
